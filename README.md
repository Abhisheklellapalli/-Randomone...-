This repository contains my learning journey, practice codes, and small projects related to Digital Electronics, Verilog HDL, and SystemVerilog.

ðŸ“Œ Whatâ€™s inside?

âœ… Basic digital circuits (adders, subtractors, comparators, multiplexers, encoders, decoders, etc.)

âœ… Verilog implementations of combinational and sequential circuits

âœ… SystemVerilog testbenches using OOP concepts (class, interface, mailbox)

âœ… Random experiments and case studies to improve design & verification skills

âœ… Simulation-ready examples (can be run on EDA Playground
 or any HDL simulator)

ðŸŽ¯ Purpose

To practice digital design concepts

To explore verification using SystemVerilog

To document my progress in VLSI / Digital Design & Verification field

To share examples with peers and anyone starting in this domain
